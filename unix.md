# Unix commands

* `cd` returns you to your home directory (e.g., `/cs/student/cgaucho/`, if your username is cgaucho)
* `pwd` prints your current working directory
* `cd cs8` changes into the cs8 directory if cs8 is in the current directory
* `cd ~/cs8` changes into the cs8 directory under your home directory regardless of the current working directory (because `~` is a shortcut for the absolute path of
   your home directory.)
* `cd ..` will move you up one directory from your current directory.
* `mkdir [dir]` will create a `[dir]` directory under your current working directory
* `ls` lists the files in your current directory
